## Central Idea for this: 

 - This will be a simple web app, not using EJS just the basics
 - We will have a page that will have a form for entering into the database
 - as well as a area to display what is in the databse 
 - it will be a favorite books database 
 
### fields for the DB 
 - Author
 - Book title 
 - Genre 


### User 
 - User will be able to create, read, update and delete books from the database
